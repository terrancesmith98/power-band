    <h1 class="text-center">How We Help</h1>
    <p class="lead">Strength Through Education, Inc. is a not-for-profit charity that was established October, 2019 based on a demonstrated need for service members to have “one-stop” online access to information that is both comprehensive and comprehensible about policy and regulations.</p>
    <h2>We Provide:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="far fa-star"></i></span>one-on-one coaching and assistance</li>
        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="far fa-star"></i></span>research and summary of the issue</li>
        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="far fa-star"></i></span>education and guidance</li>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 p-4">
            <p>Our organization currently works one-on-one with active duty service members who are experiencing an administrative concern.  We listen to the problem, determine the applicable policies and regulations, do research, summarize and annotate helpful information, and provide these resources to our client.</p>
            <p>We can provide coaching and guidance to assist the service member in asking questions and writing responses.  We do not provide legal advice;  we help “translate” the legalese of policy and regs. We do not communicate directly to command or legal counsel;  we educate and empower the service member with information they need to handle their own career concerns.  All communication is 100% confidential.</p>
