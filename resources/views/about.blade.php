        <p>Josh and Terry Smith, twin brothers, have been writing music together since the mid-eighties.  In the late eighties they formed a band, Players Club, with high-school friends Adam Oplinger and Will Oliver.  Players Club released 2 compilations on cassette in limited quantities.  The band would eventually break up as the members went on with their lives.</p>
        <p>The brothers would continue to write music in the 90's and early 2000's under the name Mirror Image.  Only home recordings were created of these songs and limited copies exist.</p>
        <p>Nearly 25 years later, Adam Oplinger, Josh Smith and Terry Smith reunited to create a new release under the name <em>Time Thief</em>, the title of their earliest releases with Players Club.</p>
        <p>Today, Josh and Terry Smith are writing under the name Power, offering a faith-based, rock and blues influenced musical message of hope and a future.</p>
