                <blockquote>Toxic leaders are a source of stress to soldiers, and toxic leadership is a form of misconduct.  Checks and balances, such as using the Chain of Command and the Inspector General, can mitigate the effects of toxic leaders.</blockquote>

                <p class="author">Aubrey:</p>
                <blockquote>Norms in the military are spelled out in regulations and standard operating procedures, but one toxic leader can redefine the norms of the organization. An organization’s response to a toxic leader sends a clear message about what the organization values.  Enabling organizations lack sufficient mechanisms to provide subordinates with opportunities to give leaders feedback or seek redress at higher levels.</blockquote>

Enhancing current doctrine must be part of the solution for toxic leadership.
