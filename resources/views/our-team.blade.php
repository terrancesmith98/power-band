                <div class="member-name">Diane Mitchell (Founder/Executive Director)</div>
                <div class="member-bio">
                    <p>Diane is the founder of Strength Through Education, Inc.  She is the proud mom of three boys, two of whom are actively serving in the military, US Army and US Air Force.  They are continuing a long, proud history of military service that touches nearly every generation in their family, and that can be traced to the Revolutionary War.  Diane is a lifelong educator.  She has held New York State teaching certification in High School English, Elementary 1-6, Elementary Special Education, and Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages.  She left a teaching career that spanned 25 years in private and public schools to launch Strength Through Education, Inc.</p>
                    <p> This organization allows her to continue following her passion for education, with a shift in focus from the classroom to the digital world.  Based on the personal experiences of her sons and their military buddies, Diane realized there is a desperate need for an educational platform providing information and support to service members through the various forms of digital medium most commonly used by this generation.  Her experience as a teacher has equipped her with the tools necessary to conduct thorough research, summarize and annotate information into a comprehensible format, and present it in a way that empowers the receiver with clear direction moving forward.</p>
