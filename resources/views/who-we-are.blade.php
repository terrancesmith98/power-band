    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3 text-center>Heroic Saga of the Organization</h3>
    <p class="text-left">Strength Through Education, Inc. was founded by my nephew’s mother, Diane Mitchell.  My nephew, A1C Adam Mitchell, is a TACP serving in the United States Air Force in Italy for the next two years.  In addition, Adam’s younger brother, CPL David Mitchell, is serving as a Combat Medic in the United States Army at Fort Bliss, Texas.  The need for Strength Through Education grew out of a heartbreaking and potentially career-ending legal experience with the Air Force that Adam went through two years ago.</p>
    <p>Without just cause, he was removed from his unit, placed on a Do Not Arm list, had his Security Clearance temporarily removed, and assigned menial jobs while the process was started for Involuntary Discharge.  It took hundreds of hours doing research, making phone calls and writing letters, trips to more than twenty Congressional offices in DC (to beg for help), and nearly $10,000 in expenses and private lawyer’s fees, in order to assist Adam with a problem that basically came down to a lack of understanding his rights, confusion about (and improperly followed) discipline regulations, and a lack of easy-to-find-and-understand informational resources.  It was then exacerbated by a lack of understanding about proper steps that could be taken to remedy the problem and no easy way to find the information and resources that were needed.</p>
    <p>Finally, after a year, Adam was completely cleared and back on his career path.  He received complete exoneration, a retro-active promotion, and he extended his enlistment.</p>
